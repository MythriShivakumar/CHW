                    <p>When I was 15, I decided I would be an engineer, not because my parents forced me to, but because
                        they got paid well enough, and I saw a great example in my sister (Go little rockstar!). So
                        naturally, my intermediate education was focused on MPC, and while it is not something I
                        remember distinctly, I do remember grinding just to get into a college. And I did. More like
                        paid to get a seat, but I did enter my engineering college. Three and a half years down the
                        lane, I currently hold four job offers (not bragging), and I have a decent enough GPA to pursue
                        higher education. Oh and yes, did I mention my 15 year old self also decided that she would
                        pursue Masters and settle abroad with a high paying job? At 15, I knew my life was sorted.
                        Sounds perfect, right? Absolutely NOT! Why did I have to try and figure out what it was that I
                        was going to do at 15! Because those decisions have led me to the current dilemma I am in. At
                        crossroads, with no clarity and admittedly a little anxiety over my entire future! Oh, if you
                        are feeling the same, welcome to the gang, and please do read on to know that YOU are DEFINITELY
                        NOT alone.</p>

                    <p>
                        I am going to begin working as a full-time employee in a few months, and I have absolutely no
                        idea if this field is something I even want to explore. But somehow I thought I would understand
                        further when I pursued my Masters. Do you guys realize the major flaw in my plan? I was willing
                        to invest heavy bucks into something I am half certain about. That is when I applied brakes on
                        my Master's plans, well that, and also my plunging GPA and decided to work for a year in my core
                        field and then decide if it is even something I see myself doing. Quite frankly, and definitely
                        not in a cocky way, I am good at my core domain. But, I know I am better at other things.
                        Writing being one of them. Upon deep introspection, I finally comprehend that the reason I have
                        been staying away from blogging has also been due to the fact that I cannot possibly fathom the
                        existence of a reality where writing might be a career option that can completely satisfy me.
                        Ironically though, so far every source of income I have received is because of my writing,
                        either as a freelancer or a part-time employee.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/cross2.jpg" alt="COVID" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>But, you might be wondering what triggered this sudden spiral? A couple of months ago, I was
                        faced with this question which summed up to elucidating about my passion. Imagine my surprise
                        and disgust when my answer was a simple “I don’t have any passion.” Could this be a lack of
                        passion? Or straight up denial? I am mentally not in the state to comprehend the right answer,
                        or maybe I am not in the state to accept it. But truth be told, I think we are all pressured
                        into knowing and charting out our course of life for the minimum of next 10 years, and I
                        personally believe that leads to people focusing on either monetary satisfaction, or
                        self-satisfaction. I am not jealous of the people who have their life planned ahead. I am very
                        happy for them, because this place isn’t great. The constant fear of failure, the anxiety of
                        probably never finding what makes you truly happy, and obviously the need to be financially
                        stable is daunting! Earlier today I came face-to-face with a certain shortlisted mail which
                        should have thrilled me to the core, but apart from being scared, I also felt as if I was
                        betraying someone. Don’t get me wrong, I know it was probably my hard work that got me to the
                        current level, but I also believe that there are other people whose dream would be that role.
                        And that was when I decided I would finish this blog. Because that weird feeling of snatching
                        something from someone sucks and no one should feel that! I strongly believe that whatever it is
                        that you receive is a fruit of your labor. So just because you think you aren’t passionate about
                        something, and still manage to do well at it, chalk it up to the fact that you put in those
                        efforts! </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/cross4.jpg" alt="COVID" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>Lacking passion, lacking clarity, lacking… Well everything… I still managed to survive, and I
                        will continue to survive, and I know you will too. I still haven’t made a choice. I have an
                        internship lined up, followed by a couple of jobs in my core domain. I still have a freelance
                        gig for writing, on my profile. I know I cannot possibly get the best of both worlds, but I do
                        know that I should have to feel the pressure to decide right this day. I think the fault has
                        always been in the fact that I pushed myself to decide. I gave myself one right option, and one
                        wrong. Somehow, I thought picking one would mean I could never do the other again in my life.
                        Yet, I know if I continue writing, I can always pull up hackerearth, or hackerrank! If I choose
                        coding, I can always write something on my blog. Even after having written all this myself, I
                        still cannot possibly accept this, because advice is easier given than followed. </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/cross3.jpg" alt="COVID" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>So, here it is. I am at a crossroads, with others that I know. But, I know it isn’t necessary for
                        me to have everything sorted today. For now I will take it a day at a time, and still be anxious
                        but also know that I can always decide, change, take a u-turn, run, and find my passion or what
                        truly makes me happy one day, down the lane. That day may not be today, but it will be someday.
                        Oh and if this blog was confusing, my brain is even fuzzier. But you can always rant, so hit me
                        up on any of the mentioned socials! </p>
                    <p>Hoping you find clarity and happiness soon,<br>M.</p>
