                    <p>I was one of the lucky souls, who could whip out a writing pad and write whatever thought I processed, immediately onto
                    the pad. The keyword being ‘was’. I uploaded my last blog on January 15th, 2021, and I went on another hiatus, but this
                    wasn’t something I wanted. I was forced into this because I could see no direction, I lacked clarity and above all, I
                    lacked inspiration. I am not trying to sound dramatic here, but it was truly one of those dark phases where I couldn't
                    seek solace in my frequent refuge, writing. </p>

                        During these troubling times, I did try churning out content. But that is exactly what it was. Churning. Not something
                        where I would put my heart and brain into. Rather, a monotonous typing that lacked any character or/and personality.
                        Before uploading any blog, and right after my first draft, I send it over to a couple of my close friends who can also
                        be called my honest critics for review. Their reaction usually ranges from ‘Damn, that’s good’ with a few expletives to
                        ‘Umm, you can add this’ to which they will even attach a link. But, it was when the reply was ‘It lacks<i>you</i> factor’ and
                        the suggestion to scrap it all off and begin again with a clear mind, that I realized, I am definitely lacking
                        something, and I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, initially.
                    </P>

                    <p>I started taking a single step back at a time. I was certain it wasn’t the topic because back then. they were something
                    I spoke about or something I supported strongly. Yet, I just couldn’t manage to convey the same in words and it was a
                    feeling I had never felt before. I knew writer’s block existed, but I never comprehended the magnitude of it until I was
                    hit with it, myself. Very often, I read that writer’s block is an excuse to be lazy, hell not just writer’s block but
                    any block is referred to as an excuse, which I strongly oppose because of my experience. A block is exactly what its
                    definition states, an obstacle to the normal progress or functioning of something. In my case, it was my thoughts. I
                    couldn’t quite think clearly because of the stress I’d been putting upon myself.</p>

                        Curly Head Creates was born in lockdown when I registered I could make something out of my writing. The enthusiasm was
                        soaring and I had enough time to write, almost every single day. In fact, I‘d go ahead and write multiple articles and
                        it was liberating. So, I went ahead and decided I’d post a blog every week and it was sort of like a mental promise to
                        myself. Gradually, my life began to move back to how it was prior to the shutdown, with several exams and deadlines. I
                        started wearing out trying to keep up this “promise” of mine. Naively, I thought a hiatus was what I required, to
                        successfully complete my exams and get back into the zone in regards to my writing. Boy, was I wrong.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/block_4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>The exams didn’t cease, and the deadlines kept growing, yet I managed to put out satisfactory content, even if it meant
                    mental turmoil to me. You may wonder if it is really tough to write about something. Trust me, it becomes taxing when
                    external factors play a part. With every article that went on my site, I started gaining followers and with that, I
                    started getting requests. For any type of content creator, it is an exhilarating moment, to receive your first request.
                    But, it was when I felt more burdened and deflated that I realized I am going about this the wrong way. When I began
                    blogging, it was out of passion. I would be excited to write, more like type, but you get the point. I didn’t notice
                    when it started taking a toll on me, but damn, it did a total number on me. With more exams looming and rather disappointing results from the previous, and other commitments, writing became just
                    another weight, when in reality it should have been my freedom.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/block_2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>I don’t speak about my feelings often, but I make sure to jot them down in my notepad. You’d be surprised to know the
                    number of notes I have on my phone. It was my way of relieving stress but how could I do it again, when that was the
                    cause of my stress. So I did what I thought was the healthiest way to overcome this situation. I stopped giving a frick
                    about writing content to please others or the deadlines I set for myself. I went back, and I looked at the notes I had
                    written when I began this journey of mine. Lo and behold, it strikes me that I write for myself and people who feel or
                    are going through anything similar to me. I did the same with my first article, <a href="single.html"><u>‘It is okay to be single!’</a></u>(Yes, it is a
                    cheap promotion.) and stopped later, because it sure made me feel vulnerable, but that is the beauty of writing. You can
                    bare your soul out there, and you’d end up feeling better because you find other souls that resonate with you. So, here
                    I am, penning down my honest feelings as a tired yet passionate writer.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>If you are a content creator of any sort or are just facing a block, I am not going to tell you the cliche ‘you are not
                    alone’ line, because it won’t do you any good. Your block may be different from mine. Mine was due to irrelevant
                    pressure I put upon myself. Yours could be due to a number of factors. But what you can do is try to overcome this
                    obstacle, take a break. Don’t think about it, at all! Just seize every moment as it comes your way, and rebuild
                    yourself. Once you find that little piece of passion again, revisit the most beautiful memory you have about what you
                    create. Find what makes this type of creation so dear to you and begin again. First, let it be just yourself, and the
                    people who make you feel comfortable, and then go ahead, scream to the world that you are back, with a stronger fire!</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>This is where I usually conclude my article, but I just wanted to put it out there, that it wouldn’t be possible without
                    my support system. And I cannot stress enough on the fact that you WILL need a support system too, when you are under
                    this sort of mental block. I had the best people around me and I cannot thank you guys enough. From nodding your head to
                    when I rhymed my name with shit to suggesting I write articles about the block and threatening me to not ‘open that can
                    of worms’, you guys have really helped me out here. Don’t cringe, but know I love you guys, and thank you for all the
                    support.</p>
                    <p>Not going to promise, I will be back the very next week with another article, but I do promise that there will be more
                    articles with honest feelings like this in the future and more fun stuff.</p>
                    <p>After all this time and until next time,<br>Tons of love,<br>M.</p>
