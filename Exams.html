                    <p>Never did I think I would have to choose between my life and my education. Not trying to sound dramatic here, but that
                    is exactly the choice I along with various students across the state of Telangana are facing. During this global
                    pandemic, our university decided it would be exceptionally wise to conduct physical exams, ignoring the rampant rise in
                    the COVID cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And, they did! Spell 1 of these exams involved the final year students to appear for their final exams. Consequently,
                        there has been a rise in the positive cases and yet, everyone is oblivious to the fact that they just endangered a whole
                        batch of students and their families in the haze of exams. Now, they are ready to do it all over again. Just with thrice
                        the amount of students in spell 2 and spell three of these exams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/ex_1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>When I came across this circular, I thought it was a prank and for valid reasons. Back at the end of April, all classes,
                    online included, were suspended and the students were promoted to the next year. Which implied that exams would not be
                    conducted for anyone other than the final year students.</p>
                    <p>
                        Naturally, we let the past semester take a backseat as we focused on various other things until the next semester began
                        in Mid August. So, it definitely seemed like fake news, especially since it was forwarded on WhatsApp. But, imagine my
                        surprise when it turned out to be an official circular from JNTU-H, the university which my institute is affiliated to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/ex_2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>For a moment, I did not know how to react because, here I was more than a month into the new semester, where a chapter
                    in each subject is done! Soon, everyone started discussing how this is going to take place, and what caught my attention
                    was how the hostel students are far away in their hometowns, away from their books!</p>
                    <p>
                        And to make it worse for them, they have to choose between writing exams without their books in a college in and around
                        their hometown. Or, they could risk it all and travel back to their institute and appear for exams at their college.
                        Clearly one risked grades while the other risked contracting this deadly virus.While writing this article, I am still nurturing this hope that I would not have to make this choice because why would
                        you want to put a student in such a situation?! But, making this choice is merely getting closer as each day passes. The
                        problems that will come along with physically appearing for these exams are huge!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/ex_3.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>There is a massive possibility that you may either test positive or be a carrier and people who you are in contact with,
                    along with your family will test positive or turn into a carrier, too! Imagine being a student who falls under the
                    high-risk category or having family members who fall into the same. God forbid, but anything unfortunate that happens
                    will certainly lead to a lot of mental trauma that will last way longer than these exam results ever will.</p>

                    <p>The pandemic itself has been taking a huge toll on everyone’s mental health. Putting fragile minds through this is
                    worse. Constantly placing them in a situation where they stress about their lives, their family’s lives, and their exams
                    is just purely unhealthy. Worst case scenario, if they end up testing positive even after all the precautions, they are
                    going to go through a whole new battle. And this battle will also burn a hole in their pocket. Not everyone can afford
                    the care they need. This is leading to the literal version of “the survival of the fittest.”</p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The last bit of faith lingers in the power of the government. I am not certain as to how that will factor in because JEE
                    and NEET along with other exams have been conducted. Surely, not on this scale, with such a rise in cases. But, it is
                    important the government pays heed to various silent protests students are holding peacefully and digitally. As we are
                    heading closer to exam dates, that is 2nd and last week of October, the students are definitely panicking. I just hope
                    that everything falls into place because hoping and praying is all one can do at this moment.</p>
                    <p>Until then , stay safe, and may the odds be ever in your favor (seems befitting)<br>Love <br>M</p>
