                    <p>Hello! Long time no see. Well, this seems to be the introduction on every post of mine these days, but oh well… I must certainly admit, it is great to be back on my blogspace after this long while. Maybe I will elaborate on this absence soon, once I get my thoughts sorted but for now, this is what we’ll be talking about today! Well, pretty sure it is more like a monologue, but we can have a conversation about the same if you hit me up on any of my socials that are mentioned! </p>
                    <p>
                        Coming to the topic on hand today… Well, I have been a woman who always preached ‘Change is constant’, but I guess I never truly interpreted it, nor did I ever implement it in my life. In hindsight, I understand how foolish I was to assume my life wasn’t changing, just because I was not acknowledging the change. For example, it was only while I was writing this that I realized I already had a mammoth change in September 2021(IYKYK). But oh well, life is funny in its own ways, because I am heading towards another life altering change, and somehow in my little mind I feel I am not ready for it, but here’s the catch; Are we ever truly ready for change?</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/Change1.jpg" alt="Change" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>So, long story short, I graduate in about a month, and I move to a different city in August. While the fact that I am graduating instills immense joy within me to be rid of the toil to constantly achieve and do my best at academics, I cannot truly revel in that happiness. I am continually running my head over how academics, where I spent the majority of my young life, will no longer be my regular routine. You know how it takes 21 days to make a habit, and all… Well, I spent 18 years chasing grades and marks! What am I even supposed to do next! So here comes the part which involves me moving… Work in a corporate setting. At first it sounds super exciting, and then when I break it down to its essence, I accept that I don’t know the first crap about being a corporate employee. Sure, I have had freelance gigs, and part-time experiences, but what entails this role of being an employee of a company? That, I have no clue about. Hence, the change. Is this adulting? Because it blows. </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/Change2.jpg" alt="Change" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>As much as people would like to deny it (you know who you are), I am a pure Hyderabadi, born and raised, and I have never thought about moving away for a job, but here I am today. To be frank, this might as well be my venting diary, because I am not ready to move to a new city with minimal malls and almost no brewery, but I guess that is life, even if I am not ready for it? But that is the question that I have not been able to wrap my head around; Why is it that we don’t like not having answers? I mean, we don’t always have answers with facts and proofs to everything, do we? Frankly speaking, it is always our firsts that scare us the most. First exam, first date, first job, first move, first flight, and well, first everything, and it is completely valid for you to be scared, because there hasn’t been any precedent set. Obviously that leads to a lot of mental chaos, and sometimes, it isn’t really healthy, but can we truly stop it? No, I am genuinely asking for myself. </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/Change3.jpg" alt="Change" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>Just kidding, I wouldn't deprive you of the answer I think I found. So, here’s my theory. We are not always ready for the curves we face, and yet, we get through it. And that is exactly what I have been chanting internally everyday, ‘I will get through it’. Of course there is always a what if, but I think one should at least go in with that confidence that it will work rather than doubting it from the very first second. Imagine you go into a first date with the mindset that you wouldn’t date the person, and boom! Word vomit! There goes your chance of dating that person, and well the precedent you set? Yep, a failed one. But hey, at least you have something to take away with you from that experience! Like I always keep telling, lessons are important, mi amor. They truly shape us to always get better, and find the most optimal solution, much like Machine Learning, had to put in a CS reference, sorry. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/Change4.jpg" alt="COVID" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                    <p>So, am I completely sorted with the idea of change now that I know I will get through it? Ha! I wish. I truly freaking wish I was, but I am not, and I do not think I will be until the first day, and probably not even after that. I am not ready to be a full time employee, I am not ready to move, I am not ready to be in this weird long distance relationship, away from my family, and friends. But, I mean, I am not the first person right? And in there, in this little place lies my mental peace. Here is where I find my much needed respite, in knowing that there have been people before me who have done it. Of course the entire experience is different and customized for everyone, but I think within all of this, we can always rely on people around us to at least empathize and probably suggest ways to cope with this change. I am not going to tell you change is easy. Change comes with a lot of rebellion, and everyone struggles a little more every day to change, but I think it is the first step that matters, and regardless of everything, remember, that you will be okay, and even if you are not, you soon will be, and that is what matters. </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>Hence, this is me asking if you are feeling similar? Have a huge change headed your way and just want to vent but don’t have a blog? Text me awayyyy! We are all on the same page, my friend. Terrified, excited, nervous, and everything at once. But, we’ll be fine. We always have been, and we will continue to be.</p>
                    <p>Until next time,<br>Showering you with love, while being terrified,<br>M.</p>
